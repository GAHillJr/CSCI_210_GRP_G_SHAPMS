Project Requirements
    Smart Healthcare Appointment & Patient Management System (SHAPMS)

Project Overview
    The goal is to build a data-structure–driven system that efficiently manages appointments, patients, doctors, and
    schedules, while using algorithms to optimize scheduling, prioritize critical patients, and track hospital activity.
    The system allows users (hospital staff and patients) to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments, manage patient
    data, and generate statistical and performance reports.

Learning Objectives
    Implement and manipulate linked lists, stacks, queues, and deques.
    Apply recursion for generating reports and managing scheduling conflicts.
    Construct and traverse binary search trees, heaps, and optionally Huffman trees.
    Use hash tables, sets, and maps for quick lookups of doctors, patients, and appointments.
    Implement and compare various sorting algorithms.
    Explore self-balancing trees for fast searching and updates.
    Collaborate to design, implement, and test a multi-component Java system.

Functional Requirements
// Appointment Management
    Add, edit, or cancel appointments (patient ID, doctor ID, date/time, reason).
    Display appointments chronologically, by doctor, or by department.
    Detect and handle scheduling conflicts using recursion.
    Manage appointment queues for walk-ins or emergency patients.

// Patient Management
    Register new patients (name, ID, age, contact info, medical history).
    Maintain records of past visits using linked lists.
    Track and limit the number of active appointments per patient.

// Doctor Management
    Add and manage doctor profiles (ID, name, specialty, schedule).
    Assign doctors to appointments based on specialty and availability.
    Maintain maps of doctor schedules and patient loads.

// Scheduling & Priority Handling
    Use priority queues for urgent or emergency cases.
    Automatically update waitlists and notify patients of cancellations.
    Detect scheduling conflicts recursively and reschedule intelligently.

// Search & Sorting
    Search for patients or doctors by name, ID, or specialty using binary search trees.
    Sort appointments by date, urgency, or doctor.
    Use heaps for “most consulted” or “busiest doctor” recommendations.

// Data Storage
    Use hash tables for constant-time access to patient and doctor records.
    Use sets to manage specialties, departments, and unique patient tags.
    Use maps to link patients with their appointments.

// Advanced Features
    Self-balancing trees (AVL/Red-Black Trees) for optimized searches.
    Priority queues for triaging emergency cases.
    Optional Huffman coding for compressing patient notes or reports.
    Recursive reports (e.g., daily summary, doctor workload, patient activity).

// User Interface
    Console-based system with menu-driven navigation.
    Display hospital data: patients, doctors, appointments, and queues.
    Allow both admin and patient roles for different actions.
